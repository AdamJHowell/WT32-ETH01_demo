# WT32-ETH01_demo
This is a project that I will use to experiment with this board.
Since this is my first ESP32 with an Ethernet port, much of my usual code will need to be modified.
I plan on modifying my MQTT connection method to select a broker, from an array of brokers, based which is pingable.
